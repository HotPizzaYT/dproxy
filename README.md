# What's this?

This is a Discord API proxy that also has a frontend. If you plan on using this on a public server, please secure it with an .htpasswd!

# Why build a proxy?

For settings like school and work, sites are often blocked on the request level, denying access to any site related to discord.com, etc.

# Why can't I access my servers?

For reasons unknown, I can't get the hair pulling code to work! It just keeps giving me 404s. Anyone who is skilled enough that knows the Discord REST/HTTP apis can solve this for me.
